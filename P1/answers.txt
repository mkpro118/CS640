Q2.
    Expected Latency: 80ms + 20ms + 60ms = 160ms
    Expected Throughput: < min(22.6 Mbps, 37.7 Mbps, 32.1 Mbps) = ~ 22.5 Mbps

    Actual Latency: 161.842 ms
    Actual Throughput: 22.7036 Mbps

Q3.
    Expected Latency two pairs of hosts: ~160ms (We don't expect latency to change with additional hosts)
    Expected Throughput two pairs of hosts: We cannot predict individual throughputs, but we expect the both throughputs to be below 20 Mbps

    Actual Latency two pairs of hosts: 161.096 ms, 161.566 ms
    Actual Throughput two pairs of hosts: 15.816 Mbps, 9.856 Mbps

    Expected Latency three pairs of hosts: ~160ms (We don't expect latency to change with additional hosts)
    Expected Throughput three pairs of hosts: We cannot predict individual throughputs, but we expect the both throughputs to be below 20 Mbps

    Actual Latency three pairs of hosts: 161.096 ms, 161.566 ms
    Actual Throughput three pairs of hosts: 15.816 Mbps, 9.856 Mbps
